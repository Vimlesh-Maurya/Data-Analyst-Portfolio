## About me

  Vimlesh Maurya is a data analyst and digital Marketer based in India. His self-professed goal is to help businesses make the right data-driven decisions.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis

#### Code: [video_games_sales.ipynb]()
Description: The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.
Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Results: Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.

Description: The final project for 5 month Data Analysis Course. Setup: you're employed in a mobile games development company. A Product Manager gives you following tasks: to find and visualize retention, to make a decision based on the A/B test data, to suggest a number of metrics to evaluate the results of the last monthly campaign.
Skills: data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, proportions z-test, bootstrapping, defining metrics.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats, Bootstrap.
Results: python functions to calculate and plot users retention, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result with a recommendation to push tested in-app changes into production, a set of metrics to evaluate success of promotion campaign.


### A Landing Page Design Experiment
#### Code: [notebook.ipynb]
Presentation: slides.pdf
Description: My solution to an open Data Analyst competition held by Карьерный Цех. The solution took the 7th place in the competition (≈100 solutions were submitted by participants).
Skills: evaluating A/B-test design, data cleaning, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, calculating conversion rate, calculating bounce rate, log-scale transformations, Shapiro–Wilk test of distribution normality, A/B-tests (proportions z-test, Mann–Whitney rank test), plotting results, making conclusion and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats.
Results: A/B test design analysis, conclusion on rolling the new landing page design to production, recommendations on how to improve.

### Online Advertising Campaign Analysis
#### Code: [ya_ad_int_solution.ipynb]
Presentation: ya_ad_int_slides_upd.pdf
Description: My submission to Yandex Advertising Analytics internship program.
Skills: data cleaning, CTR, CPC, CPA and CR calculation, comparing metrics with competitors, visualizing results, drawing conclusions.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Results: the slide deck with online advertising campaign analysis and recommendations on how to improve based on the service category.

### Airbnb Listings Analytics
#### Tableau Public: dashboard
Dashboard canvas: dashboard_canvas.pdf
Description: Tableau Public dashboard consisted of: calculated renting property occupation rate; analytical chart to choose the best property by occupation rate, review score and price per night; a ranked table of top listings by calculated potential annual revenue; average price, average occupation rate and a number of unique listings KPIs; filters by neighborhood, occupation rate and a number of reviews per the last twelve month.
Skills: interview with a customer, requirements capture, designing an analytical dashboard, product delivery.
Technology: Tableau.
Results: created an analytical dashboard to support daily activities of a company involved in apartments renting business.
