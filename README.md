## About me

  Vimlesh Maurya is a data analyst and digital Marketer based in India. His self-professed goal is to help businesses make the right data-driven decisions.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis

#### Code: [video_games_sales.ipynb]()
Description: The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.
Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Results: Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.

### Airbnb Listings Analytics
#### Tableau Public: dashboard
Dashboard canvas: dashboard_canvas.pdf
Description: Tableau Public dashboard consisted of: calculated renting property occupation rate; analytical chart to choose the best property by occupation rate, review score and price per night; a ranked table of top listings by calculated potential annual revenue; average price, average occupation rate and a number of unique listings KPIs; filters by neighborhood, occupation rate and a number of reviews per the last twelve month.
Skills: interview with a customer, requirements capture, designing an analytical dashboard, product delivery.
Technology: Tableau.
Results: created an analytical dashboard to support daily activities of a company involved in apartments renting business.

## Study Projects
