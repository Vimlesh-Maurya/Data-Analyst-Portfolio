## About me

  Vimlesh Maurya is a data analyst and digital Marketer based in India. His self-professed goal is to help businesses make the right data-driven decisions.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis

#### Code: [video_games_sales.ipynb]()
Description: The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.
Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Results: Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.

Presentation: my_project_slides.pdf
Description: The final project for 5 month Data Analysis Course. Setup: you're employed in a mobile games development company. A Product Manager gives you following tasks: to find and visualize retention, to make a decision based on the A/B test data, to suggest a number of metrics to evaluate the results of the last monthly campaign.
Skills: data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, proportions z-test, bootstrapping, defining metrics.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats, Bootstrap.
Results: python functions to calculate and plot users retention, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result with a recommendation to push tested in-app changes into production, a set of metrics to evaluate success of promotion campaign.


### A Landing Page Design Experiment
#### Code: [notebook.ipynb]
Presentation: slides.pdf
Description: My solution to an open Data Analyst competition held by Карьерный Цех. The solution took the 7th place in the competition (≈100 solutions were submitted by participants).
Skills: evaluating A/B-test design, data cleaning, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, calculating conversion rate, calculating bounce rate, log-scale transformations, Shapiro–Wilk test of distribution normality, A/B-tests (proportions z-test, Mann–Whitney rank test), plotting results, making conclusion and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats.
Results: A/B test design analysis, conclusion on rolling the new landing page design to production, recommendations on how to improve.

### Airbnb Listings Analytics
#### Tableau Public: dashboard
Dashboard canvas: dashboard_canvas.pdf
Description: Tableau Public dashboard consisted of: calculated renting property occupation rate; analytical chart to choose the best property by occupation rate, review score and price per night; a ranked table of top listings by calculated potential annual revenue; average price, average occupation rate and a number of unique listings KPIs; filters by neighborhood, occupation rate and a number of reviews per the last twelve month.
Skills: interview with a customer, requirements capture, designing an analytical dashboard, product delivery.
Technology: Tableau.
Results: created an analytical dashboard to support daily activities of a company involved in apartments renting business.

## Study Projects

In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### ML course
Description: Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn by France Université Numérique. The course official page.
This 3 month course is an in-depth introduction to predictive modeling with scikit-learn. Step-by-step and didactic lessons introduce the fundamental methodological and software tools of machine learning, and is as such a stepping stone to more advanced challenges in artificial intelligence, text mining, or data science.
Repository: Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course lectures and tasks' solutions ---> go to repo..
Status: Completed in May 2022 (please, check the certificates section below).

### Data Analyst Specialization
Description: This is a 5 month specialization by karpov.courses. The specialization includes Python, API, Git, Airflow, SQL, Statistics, A/B testing, Visualization, Product development and Product Analytics modules.
Repository: Check the repository having 37 data analysis mini-projects ---> go to repo..
Status: Completed in July 2021 (please, check the certificates section below).

### Data Analysis Course Tinkoff-MSU
Description: This is a 3 month course by Tinkoff Education. The course was created for Moscow State University Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics students and includes following topics: Introduction to Data Analysis, SQL, Data Visualization in Python, A/B tests, Data Interpretation, Models, Logistic regression, Mobile Analytics, Random Forest, etc..
Repository: Check the repository having my code and solutions for home-tasks and projects of the course ---> go to repo..

Status: Completed in May 2021 (please, check the certificates section below).

### Learning SQL
Description: SQL queries for tasks from codecademy, sql-ex.ru, stepik, sql module on Yandex Praktikum, etc.
Repository: Check the repository having 400+ SQL queries ---> go to repo..
Status: Some of the courses are still in progress.

### Learning Python
Description: 25 projects, 154 hours, 300 topics python developer track from JetBrains Academy
Repository: Check the repository having 11 completed projects including: Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors games; Matrix calculator, own-coded Regex engine, To-Do list, etc. ---> go to repo..
Status: Completed 11 projects, studied 116 topics from the track to practice my python skills. Will revert back to the track later.


## Certificates
